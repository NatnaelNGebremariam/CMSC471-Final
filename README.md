# CMSC471-Final

War statistics often reduce real lives to abstract numbers, but behind every figure lies a story of loss, sacrifice, and consequence. The Moral Cost of War is an interactive data visualization project that explores the human toll of World War II and its broader context within American military history. Through five thoughtfully curated visualizations, we examine turning points in WWII, compare military and civilian casualties by country, follow the human flow of U.S. wartime deaths, and put America’s losses into historical perspective. Each visualization invites you to engage with the data, uncover hidden patterns, and reflect on how war transforms societies.

Chapter 2: Who Bore the Weight – Total Deaths by Country
This visualization presents the total number of deaths in the countries most affected by World War II, including the USSR, Germany, Poland, and China. By comparing nations side by side, it reveals the staggering scale of loss each endured—some in the tens of millions—highlighting the uneven human cost of global conflict. It also prompts reflection on how geography, occupation, and war strategies determined a country’s fate during the war.

Chapter 3: The U.S. War Effort – A Population in Motion
This Sankey diagram zooms in on the United States, showing how its wartime population was distributed among civilians, enlisted soldiers, wounded, and those who lost their lives. The visualization presents not just death tolls, but also how war touches multiple layers of a society—from healthy young citizens to grieving families. By watching the flow of people from one group to another, we gain a sense of proportion: how many served, how many survived, and how many were lost.

Chapter 4: Drafted into History – U.S. Conscription Across the 20th Century
This heat map places WWII in broader American military history, comparing the number of people drafted into service across four major wars: World War I, World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. The darker the color, the greater the number of draftees—a quick and powerful visual of national mobilization. This comparison shows just how uniquely massive the draft was during WWII, and how it reshaped American demographics and labor back home.

Chapter 5: Death Across Eras – U.S. War Fatalities Through Time
To close the story, this animated bar graph pans out and compares U.S. military deaths across every major American conflict, from the Revolutionary War to modern engagements. The animation puts WWII into historical perspective, highlighting that while it was one of the deadliest wars, it wasn’t the costliest in American history—the Civil War still holds that tragic distinction. As the bars rise and fall, the animation reminds us that every war leaves a different legacy of loss.
Watch the animation unfold to inspect specific wars and their death tolls.
