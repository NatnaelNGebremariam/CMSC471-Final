    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>
        War statistics often reduce real lives to abstract numbers, but behind every figure lies a story of loss,
        sacrifice, and consequence. The Moral Cost of War is an interactive data visualization project that explores
        the human toll of World War II and its broader context within American military history. Through five
        thoughtfully curated visualizations, we examine turning points in WWII, compare military and civilian casualties
        by country, follow the human flow of U.S. wartime deaths, and put America’s losses into historical perspective.
        Each visualization invites you to engage with the data, uncover hidden patterns, and reflect on how war
        transforms societies.

        <h1>WWII Timeline</h1>
        <p2>
            <strong>Chapter 1: </strong>The War Unfolds – An Annotated Timeline
            This interactive timeline traces the chronological milestones of World War II, beginning with the invasion
            of Poland in 1939 and progressing through major global turning points. It contextualizes key events like
            Operation Barbarossa and the attack on Pearl Harbor, allowing you to understand when and how the war
            expanded in scope. By following this timeline, readers gain a bird’s-eye view of the conflict’s progression,
            helping frame the deeper data presented later.

                Strategically located only 660 miles from Tokyo, the Pacific island became the site

        <h1>WWII Total Deaths</h1>
        <p2>
            <strong>Chapter 2:</strong> Who Bore the Weight – Total Deaths by Country
            This visualization presents the total number of deaths in the countries most affected by World War II,
            including the USSR, Germany, Poland, and China. By comparing nations side by side, it reveals the
            staggering scale of loss each endured—some in the tens of millions—highlighting the uneven human cost of
            global conflict. It also prompts reflection on how geography, occupation, and war strategies determined a
            country’s fate during the war.
            <strong>Hover over each bar or area segment to see the exact death toll for each nation.</strong>

        <h1>Sankey Diagram: WW2 Population Progress</h1>
        <p2>
            <strong>Chapter 3:</strong> The U.S. War Effort – A Population in Motion
            This Sankey diagram zooms in on the United States, showing how its wartime population was distributed among
            civilians, enlisted soldiers, wounded, and those who lost their lives. The visualization presents not just
            death tolls, but also how war touches multiple layers of a society—from healthy young citizens to grieving
            families. By watching the flow of people from one group to another, we gain a sense of proportion: how many
            served, how many survived, and how many were lost.
            <strong>Follow the streams in the diagram and hover to view numbers at each stage.</strong>

        <h1>US Military Inductions During Major Wars</h1>
        <p2>
            <strong>Chapter 4: </strong>Into History – U.S. Conscription Across the 20th Century
            This heat map places WWII in broader American military history, comparing the number of people drafted into
            service across four major wars: World War I, World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. The darker
            the color, the greater the number of draftees—a quick and powerful visual of national mobilization. This
            comparison shows just how uniquely massive the draft was during WWII, and how it reshaped American
            demographics and labor back home.
            <strong>Hover over the grid to view draft numbers by year.</strong>

            <h1>Army Casualties by War</h1>
            <strong>Chapter 5: </strong>To close the story, this animated bar graph pans out and compares U.S. military deaths across every major American conflict, from the Revolutionary War to modern engagements. 
            The animation puts WWII into historical perspective, highlighting that while it was one of the deadliest wars, it wasn’t the costliest in American history—the Civil War still holds that tragic distinction. 
            As the bars rise and fall, the animation reminds us that every war leaves a different legacy of loss.
            <strong>Watch the animation unfold to inspect specific wars and their death tolls.
